# Music Store Data Analysis using SQL
This project demonstrates a comprehensive SQL-based data analysis on a fictional music store database. The objective is to answer various business-related questions through well-structured SQL queries, helping stakeholders understand customer behavior, sales performance, and music preferences.

## Project Overview
The dataset simulates a digital music retail platform with information about customers, employees, artists, albums, tracks, invoices, and genres. The project is organized into three difficulty levels to gradually build analytical depth and complexity.

The analysis aims to extract actionable insights such as identifying top customers, popular genres by country, revenue-generating cities, and artist performance.

## Tools and Technologies
SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite)

SQL IDEs such as DB Browser for SQLite, pgAdmin, or MySQL Workbench

Optional integration with Jupyter Notebook for further analysis and visualization

## File Structure
music_store_analysis.sql: Contains all SQL queries used for analysis

README.md: Documentation and project overview

music_store.db or music_store.sql: Database file or SQL script to create the database

## Query Categories
Question Set 1 - Easy
Identify the senior-most employee by job title

Determine which countries have the most invoices

Find the top three invoice amounts

Identify the city generating the highest total sales

Determine the best customer based on total spending

## Question Set 2 - Moderate
Retrieve email and names of customers who listen to Rock music

Identify the top ten rock artists based on number of tracks

List all tracks with duration above the average

## Question Set 3 - Advanced
Calculate how much each customer spent on the top-selling artist

Determine the most popular music genre by country

Identify the highest-spending customer in each country

These queries use SQL features such as joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and window functions like ROW_NUMBER to perform multi-dimensional analysis.

## Key Insights
Rock is the most popular genre across many countries

Customers in the United States contribute the highest revenue

The top customers account for a significant portion of overall sales

Cities like Prague and Paris are key revenue contributors
